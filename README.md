# FACOWEB - FACOoya WEB

This commit was created to archive the early version history of FACOWEB
and to organize the progression of development up to the latest versions in a structured way.

### Note:
- Links have been adjusted to support opening via `file://` paths in browsers  
- For more detailed update notes, please refer to the `document_page_v1.1.2a.html` file.  

This version is overly complex for practical use.  
Please refer to the latest source code instead.
