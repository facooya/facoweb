# FACOWEB - FACOoya WEB

This commit was created to archive the early version history of FACOWEB  
and to organize the progression of development up to the latest versions in a structured way.

This commit version is overly complex for practical use.  
Please refer to the latest source code instead.

This project cannot be run directly via **file** due to the use of module imports and dynamic resource loading.  
Please run it through a local web server and access it via **localhost**.

### Note:
- License comments have been updated to **SPDX** format in all **CSS** and **JS** files.
- All links have been updated to explicitly include the **html** extension.
- The document path has been reorganized based on the project structure.
- Icons and logos have been replaced with geometric shapes.
- For the original update notes written at that time, please refer to the `tmp/doc-page.html` file.
