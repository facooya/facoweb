# FACOWEB - FACOoya WEB

Versions prior to `v1.0.0` were not preserved due to the overwrite-style update approach.  
As a result, this commit marks the beginning of the project history from `v1.0.0`, originally created in 2023.  

This commit was created to archive the early version history of FACOWEB  
and to organize the progression of development up to the latest versions in a structured way.

### Note:
- Links have been adjusted to support opening via `file://` paths in browsers  
- License comments have been added to all CSS and JS files

This version is overly complex for practical use.  
Please refer to the latest source code instead.
