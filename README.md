# FACOWEB - FACOoya WEB

This commit was created to archive the early version history of FACOWEB
and to organize the progression of development up to the latest versions in a structured way.

This project cannot be run directly via **file** due to the use of module imports and dynamic resource loading.
Please run it through a local web server and access it via **localhost**.  

### Note:
- License comments have been added to all CSS and JS files.  
- All links have been updated to explicitly include the `.html` extension.
- For more detailed update notes, please refer to the `document_page_v1.1.5a.html` file.  

This version is overly complex for practical use.  
Please refer to the latest source code instead.
